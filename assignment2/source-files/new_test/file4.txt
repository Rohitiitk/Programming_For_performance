A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded 
history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an
 army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in

Charge: Mr. Indra Pal Singh and all lab staff (Mr. IP Singh, Mr.
AK Verma, Mr. Rakesh Dixit, Mr. Gourav Mishra, Mr. Nripen
Deka, Mr. Bharat Raj Singh, Mr. Anurag Prasad, Mr. Pappu)
for their constant supervision and encouragement which helped
us in the completion of the project.
Special thanks to our TAs, Mr. Kunal Kishore and Mr. Rajneesh
Pandey for giving us their valuable time.
Overall, we thank our Instructor-In-Charge, Dr. Niraj Chawake,
for providing us with this opportunity to learn, explore and make
something valuable using the different manufacturing processes.
INTRODUCTION
A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was to understand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in ancient times.
It was very famous at the time of kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-looking structure.
The knowledge of manufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering projects gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.
