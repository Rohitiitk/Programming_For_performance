INTRODUCTION
A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was to understand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in ancient times.
It was very famous at the time of kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-looking structure.
The knowledge of manufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering projects gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in
 royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunti
ng. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots sig
nified the strength of 
an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was to understand the structural and
 functional
aspects of a chariot, a
 precious asset during wars and
transportation in ancient times.
It was very famous at the time of kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-looking structure.
The knowledge of manufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering projects gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for g
ames, and in races.
On knowing the 
following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for g
ames, and in races.
On knowing the 
following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was t
o unde
rstand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in a
ncient times.
It was very famous at the time of
 kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-l
ooking structure.
The knowledge of m
anufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering proje
cts gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

INTRODUCTION
A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was to understand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in ancient times.
It was very famous at the time of kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-looking structure.
The knowledge of manufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering projects gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in
 royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunti
ng. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots sig
nified the strength of 
an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for games, and in races.
On knowing the following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was to understand the structural and
 functional
aspects of a chariot, a
 precious asset during wars and
transportation in ancient times.
It was very famous at the time of kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-looking structure.
The knowledge of manufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering projects gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for g
ames, and in races.
On knowing the 
following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.
Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was t
o unde
rstand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in a
ncient times.
It was very famous at the time of
 kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-l
ooking structure.
The knowledge of m
anufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering proje
cts gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

The cityscape at night is a mesmerizing sight. 
Neon lights illuminate the skyscrapers, creating a vibrant display. 
Cars move along the streets like glowing trails. 
People gather at cafes and theaters, enjoying the nightlife that the city has to offer.
A cozy cafe nestled on a bustling street corner. 
The aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, enticing passersby to step inside. 
Friends chat over steaming mugs, sharing stories and laughter. 
The atmosphere is warm and inviting, a perfect place to unwind.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for g
ames, and in races.
On knowing the 
following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was t
o unde
rstand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in a
ncient times.
It was very famous at the time of
 kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-l
ooking structure.
The knowledge of m
anufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering proje
cts gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.

A chariot is a carriage-like vehicle used in ancient times
and driven by horses used in royal processions and in
warfare, racing and hunting. The chariot was one of the
most important inventions in history.
It gave humanity its first concept of personal transport,
and for two thousand years it was the key technology of
war – for most of humanity's recorded history, the number
of chariots signified the strength of an army. Chariots
continued to be used for travel and transport, in
processions, for g
ames, and in races.
On knowing the 
following exciting facts about chariots, we
have given our best try to replicate a scale model of a war
chariot. By adding an inter-connected system of gears, we
have caused the offensive blades to rapidly spin to chop
away the enemies.

Page 3MOTIVATION
Our Project is WAR CHARIOT. The motivation behind this
project was t
o unde
rstand the structural and functional
aspects of a chariot, a precious asset during wars and
transportation in a
ncient times.
It was very famous at the time of
 kings. We wanted to learn
about the different tools, techniques and materials used to
build such a complex-l
ooking structure.
The knowledge of m
anufacturing processes learnt in
TA201 applied to large-scale engineering proje
cts gives us
a natural feel of how functions work in real-life systems.
